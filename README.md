dnskeys
=======

A Python Library for Authenticating Keys using DNS. This library was
written by Iain Learmonth and Sathyanarayanan Gunasekaran at the
Kings of Code Hack Battle 2014 with the support of Versign.

The library provides functions to:

 * Retrieve OTR fingerprints for Jabber IDs
 * Validate OTR fingerprints for Jabber IDs using DNSSEC

If time permits, it will:

 * Retrieve and validate GPG and TLS things too.
